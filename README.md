snake 2.0 - sql

1. Download all the java files + picture 
2. Basically, my project involved an SQL database that was created locally. To make sure it runs on yours you may need to create the necessary tables on the user's laptop using the SQLiteJDBCDriverConnection class. Also, you can use an SQL editor like PopSQL or one online.
  To not use the database just comment out the code at the end when the solo mode game ends and it makes a call to establish a JDBC connection.
3. Everything else should work fine, but if not feel free to reach out at this email:
